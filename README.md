# Advancing-Monocular-Depth-Estimation
This repository features two approaches to monocular depth estimation: a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based model for fast, low-resolution predictions in real-time applications, and depth enhancement techniques applied to ZoeDepth for enhanced accuracy with low overhead via edge sharpening, superpixel segmentation, and high-frequency patch refinement.
